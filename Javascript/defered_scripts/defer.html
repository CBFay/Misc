         the defer attribute indicates tht the script won't alter
        of the page as it is executed, and that it can be run safely
        after the page has been parsed. Download will begin immediately,
        but execution will be defered.

        <!--
        the async attribute is like defer, but doesn't guarantee a particular
        order of execution. Asynchronous scripts should not modify the DOM as
        they are loading.

        It's still best to put defered scripts at the bottom of the page.
